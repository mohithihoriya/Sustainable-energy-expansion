* Problem description
   * Before the company can create new solar farms to maximize its profits, the question naturally arises:
      
      Where should we place how many m2 of solar farms to maximize our profit and at the same time meet our increasing customer demand for electricity?

      * Scenario 1: New demand for electricity: 2 million kWh/a. 
      * Scenario 2: New demand for electricity: 3 million kWh/a.


* Limitations and Information

   1. Geographic Regions: The country is divided into four regions: North-West, North-East, South-West, and South-East.
   2. Minimum Solar Farm Size: To ensure that all people in the country have access to power supply within short distances, a minimum of 100m2 of solar farm must be built in each region.
   3. Maximum Building Space: The maximum area that can be built in each region is limited:

     * North-West: 3,000m2
     * North-East: 3,000m2
     * South-West: 2,000m2
     * South-East: 2,000m2
   4. Cost Considerations: The cost for one square meter of solar plant is 100€ for the material.
In addition to the material cost, Smart Energy LLC also needs to consider the cost of the land.
The total budget available for investment is currently 2 million €.
In scenario 2, the budget for investment increases to 3 million €.
   4. Data Availability: Two datasets are available for the analysis:
Sunshine hours: This dataset provides information about the amount of sunshine hours in different geographic locations.
Land prices: This dataset provides information about the prices of land in different geographic locations.
Database of already installed solar farms: This dataset contains information about solar farms that are already installed.
