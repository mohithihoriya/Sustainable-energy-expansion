# Sustainable-energy-expansion

* Working environment

   The current demand for renewable energy is increasing rapidly. This is partly due to the growing attention being paid to the issue of green, sustainable energy, but also because of the very sharp rise in electricity prices for fossil fuels.
   In order to further develop the company Smart Energy LLC in a future-proof manner, new solar farms are to be built, which should ensure that the demand for electricity at Smart Energy LLC increases and that more profit can be generated in the long term.

* Problem description

   Before the company can create new solar farms to maximize its profits, the question naturally arises:
   Where should we place how many m² of solar farms to maximize our profit and at the same time meet our increasing customer demand for electricity?
   * Scenario 1: New demand for electricity: 2 million kWh/a. 
   * Scenario 2: New demand for electricity: 3 million kWh/a.
   
* Limitations and Information

   Unfortunately, Smart Energy LLC cannot provide unlimited financial resources, and there are restrictions on geographic location
   and construction.

   * Management imposed limitations and information:
      * We divide our country into 4 regions (North-West, North-East, South-West and South-East) for simplicity. -In order that all people in our country have short distances in the power supply, at least 100m2 of solar farm must be built in each region. -Unfortunately, the building space in the regions is limited so may be built in the regions max following area:

            -North-West: 3,000m²
            -North-East: 3,000m²
            -South-West: 2,000 m² -Sunshine hours and land prices by geographic location.
            -South-East: 2,000m²
       * For one square meter of solar plant Smart Energy LLC has to pay 100€ for the material plus the cost of the land. -Currently Smart Energy LLC can invest only 2 million €.
       * In order to fulfill scenario 2, a budget of 3 million € can be invested.
       * In order to perform the analysis, 2 data sets are available:
       * Database of already installed solar farms
